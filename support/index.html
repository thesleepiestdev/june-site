 <p>listed below are ways you can help, both paid and free, to support what i do.</p><br>
        <h1>paid methods</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://streamelements.com/june_nyan/tip">tip me via StreamElements</a> - goes through PayPal. if you do this while i'm live, you can leave a message to appear on screen!</li><br>
            <li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/editsfromjune/edit-a-video-for-your-youtube-channel">get me to edit a video for you</a> - that's a link to my Fiverr, but if you'd prefer, you can get in touch via my email <a href="mailto:editsbyjunee@gmail.com">editsbyjunee@gmail.com</a>. my portfolio is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@editsbyjunee">here</a> </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h1>free methods</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@junewastaken">watch my YouTube</a> - watch time, likes, comments, subscriptions, they all really do help with pushing videos into the algorithm and getting it suggested to more people who may like it! sharing with a friend also helps considerably &lt;3</li><br>
            <li><a href="https://twitch.tv/june_nyan">watch my Twitch</a> - my next goal is to average 3 viewers across 4 streams in a 30-day period. if i can do that, we can apply for affiliate, allowing for channel points, subs and ads!</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>affiliate links</h2>
            <p>if you find yourself signing up to any of these services, use of an affiliate link will give me (and in some cases you) a kickback for no extra charge!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://app.tuta.com/signup?ref=ektmR3FWZG8">Tuta Mail</a> - privacy-respecting email service. if you join with my link, i get 25% of your first payment in account credit, and you get an additional free month!</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
