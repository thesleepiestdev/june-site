       <p>i'm june, but you <i>might</i> have known that already ^^''</p>
        <p>i enjoy spending time with my friends, and producing videos and streams, so when you put those two things together, my channel is what you get!</p>
        <p>i have anxiety issues and have never coped too well in large social situations in person, so the internet has helped to fill that gap for me — i'm much more comfy behind a screen.</p>
        <p>i made my first video in 2010 at the age of 6 in Windows Movie Maker on an old XP machine.<br><br>

        <p>i started watching YouTube in 2011 and started seriously creating in 2014 with Camtasia Studio 8. in 2016, i upgraded to my first PC with a dedicated GPU - a humble GeForce GTX 1050 Ti! along with it, i also upgraded to Sony Vegas Pro as Camtasia Studio was stuck in 32-bit land and would crash with bigger projects.</p>
        <p>i spent the next few years making videos and streaming — i never took a video editing course or anything, just played around myself and looked up tutorials online if i couldn't figure something out. upgrading resolutions, PCs and ambition, i eventually outgrew Vegas Pro, and in 2021, i saw the light for the first time. <i>okay that's a lil dramatic BUT-</i></p>
        <p>in 2021 i got curious and installed the Final Cut Pro trial on a late 2014 mac mini, and had my little mind BLOWN at the performance, and this is going from Vegas Pro on an i7-10750H/RTX 2060M/NVME SSD/16GB DDR4 to the latest version of Final Cut Pro and macOS on an i5-4278U/5400RPM 2.5" HDD/8GB DDR3! scrubbing through the timeline was a breeze, but it wasn't just the speed that i was amazed by; it was the approach.</p>
        <p>you see and hear your video just by moving the mouse over the timeline, no buttons to click or items to drag. that little feature alone made a huge difference in terms of productivity when cutting! additionally, the proxy function gave you control over how you wanted it to end up, unlike Vegas' "click-and-pray" style.</p>
        <p>the BIGGEST deal for me, though, was that there is no save. in fact, if you try to hit Cmd+S (which VEGAS permanently embedded into me due to CONSTANT crashes, i now mash Ctrl/Cmd+S on EVERYTHING x3), it just beeps at you, as if to say you've pressed an invalid key. yes, gone are the days of having to cancel your render at 24% due to pesky frame 3774 locking the whole program up for some reason. no more "take a shot every crash" minigames that'd have you wasted 5 minutes into editing.
        <p>the 90-day trial of Final Cut Pro on that 2014 mac mini made me realise that i am not <i>nearly</i> as locked into Vegas Pro as i once thought. sure, there'll be lots of little things to learn, but once you've got the basics of NLEs down, you can largely work across any of them, and change keybinds to make the transition even easier! the mac itself though, did show its age, and was struggling to keep up with the latest build of macOS, and my 4K footage. i patted it and set it aside, it had done well.</p>
        <p>coming back to Vegas Pro on my PC after a few months, i thought "this must be what a toxic relationship feels like" and went hunting for alternatives. i had heard of DaVinci Resolve before but had yet to try it until this point, and it was free so i gave it a download. my god does that program ever fly! it "borrows" plenty from Final Cut, but i didn't mind as i liked how things worked there! although it's free, it's a <i>seriously</i> powerful editor, and i ended up primarily switching to it for the following years to come, only using Vegas Pro a couple times for the first couple years when i needed a certain effect i didn't yet know how to recreate.</p>
        <p>fast forward to today, i've started a new channel and have recently started to get these 'pops' in my audio with every cut in the timeline, with neither a possible explanation as to why, nor a fix. meanwhile, the compatibility issues i've been having with Kdenlive, a free-and-open-source video editor by the KDE team, have been completely solved! perhaps it's time to give that a serious look? only time will tell!</p>
        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> i'm a self-taught video editing and streaming nerd. i'd love to learn a programming language one day (HTML hardly counts) but it's difficult to find time for that when i find streaming and making vides with my friends so fulfilling!</p>
        <p>i hope you've had an enjoyable time reading this page, and i hope you enjoy the stuff i produce!</p>
